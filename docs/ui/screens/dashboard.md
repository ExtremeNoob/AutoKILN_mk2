For each of the 4 screens, write a **Screen Spec**:

- Purpose (“what decision does the user make here?”)
- Primary widgets + priority order
- Edge cases: comms lost, sensor stale, overtemp, SSR stuck-on suspicion, door open, etc.
- Interaction rules: tap/hold, confirmation prompts, disabled states
- Navigation rules: how you get here, how you leave, what persists
